homebrew-pathvisio
==================

Homebrew formula for pathvisio.

## Usage

```bash
$ brew tap kozo2/homebrew-pathvisio
$ brew install pathvisio
```

## Troubleshooting

* Run `brew update` — then try again.
* Run `brew doctor` — the doctor diagnoses common issues.
* Check that **Command Line Tools for Xcode (CLT)** and/or **Xcode** are up to
  date by checking for updates in the App Store.
* You can create a gist log with `brew gist-logs pathvisio`.
* Use `--verbose` to get the verbose output, i.e. `brew install --HEAD --verbose pathvisio`.
* Use `--debug` to be in the debug mode. In the debug mode, when failing, you
  can go into the interactive shell to check the building files before homebrew
  neutralizing them.
